Basic Express Handlebars practice with bullet list.
Briefing:
1) Install node js and express-handlebars (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
2) Create a bullet list like those shown at: https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#partials

Run it in VS Code terminal (node app.js) and type in a web browser "localhost:3000".

NOTES:
I ended up referring to this video-tutorial for further instructions:
